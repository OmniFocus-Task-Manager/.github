## About OmniFocus
OmniFocus represents a sophisticated implementation of professional task management principles, designed specifically for individuals who manage complex responsibilities across multiple domains. Rather than providing a simple checklist, it offers a structured system for capturing, organizing, reviewing, and executing tasks based on established productivity methodologies. The application recognizes that effective task management involves more than just recording what needs to be done—it requires systems for prioritizing work based on context, energy levels, and strategic importance, while providing mechanisms for regular review to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

The platform distinguishes itself through its deep integration of David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology while offering the flexibility to adapt to individual workflows. The perspective system allows users to create customized views that surface exactly the right tasks at the right time, whether focusing on a specific project, location, energy level, or deadline. This filtering capability transforms overwhelming task lists into manageable, contextualized work sets. The review system institutionalizes the crucial practice of regularly evaluating commitments and progress, while the forecast view helps anticipate upcoming deadlines and plan work accordingly. This combination of rigorous methodology with thoughtful interface design makes OmniFocus particularly valuable for executives managing complex portfolios, creatives juggling multiple projects, academics balancing teaching and research, and anyone whose responsibilities require systematic organization rather than simple task listing.
